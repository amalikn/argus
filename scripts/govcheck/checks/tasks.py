    Two defects, one root cause — the recipe does not say which interpreter it means:

    1. A BARE `python3`/`node`/`npx`/`ruby` resolves to whatever is on PATH, not to what .mise.toml pins.
    2. `mise exec -- python` resolves to the venv only while `_.python.venv` activation applies. It tests clean, reads
       as pinned, and degrades SILENTLY to the host interpreter when that activation stops holding.

    Both are the "it works on the machine it was written on" class. Recipes must address {{py}} by path and depend on
    _require-venv. Node has no venv layer, so `mise exec -- node` is the legitimate explicit form for it and is allowed.

    Rule: the runtime-isolation section of skill-ai-it's SKILL.md, and the RUNTIME PINNING header of templates/justfile.
